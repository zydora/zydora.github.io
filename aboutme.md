**Bio**:
Since 2018, I am a Ph.D. student in Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong. I received my B.Sc. degree at Wuhan University in 2018.

**Research Interests**
My growing research interests lie in the aspects below:
- Tensor decomposition algorithms(My Ph.D. topic)
- Computer Vision
- Causal Inference
- Network Science

**Travel | Music | Reasoning and Suspense**
I spend my spare time on accumulation of the truth other than the beauties accessible in the papers and books. The two perfect and complementary mediums are *traveling* and *music*. The inspection of history, culture, and economic situation during the preparation of vacation is an interesting thing for me. For the days when it is inconvenient to travel around, thanks for the persistent pursuiting of nature and harmony in melody of human, I'd like to be focused on the light music and symthony without other activities.

Another kind of activiy that I considered worthful of time is enjoying the works of reasoning and suspense.
