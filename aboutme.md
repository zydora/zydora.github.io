**Bio**:
Since 2018, I am a Ph.D. student in Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong. I received my B.Sc. degree at Wuhan University in 2018.

**Research Interests**
My growing research interests lie in the aspects below:
- Tensor decomposition algorithms(My Ph.D. topic)




**Travel | Music | Reasoning and Suspense**
I spend my spare time on accumulation of the truth and the history other than the beauties accessible in the papers and books. The two perfect and complementary mediums are traveling and music. Inspection of history, culture, and economic situation is an interesting thing for me before the vacation. While for the days that are inconvenient for travelling around, thanks for persistent pursuiting of nature and harmony in melody, I'd like to enjoy the light music and symthony without any activity.

Another kind of activiy that I think is worthful is enjoying the works of reasoning and suspense.
