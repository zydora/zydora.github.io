1. Presentation is quite important for everyone, especially for Ph.D. student. It is the core of competition.
2. Time Management, Emotion recognition and control, communication, are three aspects should be realized at the beginning.
3. Efficiency plays a critical role in research, not only for competition with groups all over the world, but also for consistency and persistent output. “上士闻道，勤而行之”
4. It is not a good choice to get all things prepared before start doing things. Another efficiency-killing guy is the perfectionism. Done unperfectly is better than half.
5. For Ph.D. student, the one could rely on is oneself. But leveraging proven experience and help from others could provide a way with less mistakes. “兼听则明”
6. For a direction in Engineering, it is better to command the foundation theorems such as mathematics through a book, accompanied by some practices. Then, the one should just focus on innovation with papers and codes. Books will hurt the attention and efficiency.
7. Improving English will enhance lots of things, efficiency, impression of profession, and the mind.
8. Piece notifications such as wechat official, twitter, zhihu/quora, are a good news media for communication purpose but not study materials. In order to formulate one's own systematic knowledge library, one should search and sort materials according to his own mind.
